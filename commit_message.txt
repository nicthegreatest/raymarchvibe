feat: Enhance audio-reactive shaders and fix core functionalities

This commit introduces significant enhancements to audio-reactive shaders and addresses several critical bugs:

- `organic_audio_viz.frag`:
  - Improved bar edge softening with adaptive `fwidth` and increased rounding influence.
  - Added a "Bar Rounding" control for more organic shapes.
- `organic_fractal_tree.frag`:
  - Transformed into a multi-band audio visualizer with dynamic thickness, angle, and heart shape reactivity.
  - Implemented audio-reactive coloring for the tree and background.
  - Added audio-reactive UV warping for psychedelic effects.
  - Corrected GLSL version compatibility (explicit `#version 330 core`, `out vec4 FragColor`).
  - Tuned default parameters for a balanced visual experience and reordered UI controls for clarity.
  - Integrated into Node Editor's "Generators" menu.
- `src/ShaderParser.cpp`:
  - Fixed a bug in the uniform parsing regex to correctly detect all UI controls.
- `src/VideoRecorder.cpp`:
  - Fixed "off-centre" video output by explicitly setting `glViewport` during frame capture.
- `GEMINI.md`:
  - Updated documentation to reflect changes in `VideoRecorder`, `ShaderParser`, and GLSL integration workflow.
