feat(camera): implement spherical camera controls

Implements a new spherical (orbital) camera control system to provide a more intuitive way to navigate the 3D scene.

- Replaces the previous linear pan and tilt with an orbital system.
- Left-click + drag now orbits the camera around a central target point.
- Right-click + drag now pans the camera's target point.
- Mouse wheel now zooms in and out by adjusting the camera's distance from the target.
- Updates the main loop to calculate the camera's position from spherical coordinates.
- Adds `iCameraPosition` and `iCameraMatrix` uniforms to shaders.
- Updates `raymarch_v2.frag` as an example of how to use the new camera uniforms.
- Updates `GEMINI.md` to document the new camera system.
