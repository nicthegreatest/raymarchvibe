RaymarchVibe âœ¨ BETA/EXPERIMENTAL

![app-screenshot]([https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f05a5f99-e497-449d-8df6-46cab469311d](https://github.com/nicthegreatest/raymarchvibe/blob/main/documentation/raymarchvibe_screen.png?raw=true))

## Vision: A Modern SDF / Raymarching Tool

This tool is designed for shader exploration and creative coding, inspired by the demoscene spirit. It allows artists and developers to intuitively build complex visual effects by connecting shaders in a graph, manipulating their parameters in real-time, and seeing the results instantly. It aims to lower the barrier to entry for creating generative art and encourages a workflow based on experimentation and discovery.

Dive in, tweak, explore, and vibe with your shaders!

## Key Features

*   **Node-Based Visual Programming:** Create complex, multi-pass effects by connecting shaders together in an intuitive node graph.
*   **Advanced Real-time Shader Editor:** Powered by ImGuiColorTextEdit for GLSL syntax highlighting, line numbers, and error marking.
*   **Dynamic UI Generation:** Automatically generate UI controls (sliders, color pickers) for shader uniforms by adding a single line of JSON in your shader comments.
*   **Advanced Audio Reactivity:** Drive shader animations with real-time audio analysis, using not just overall amplitude but also four distinct frequency bands (bass, mids, highs).
*   **Video & Audio Recording:** Record your creations to high-quality video files (MP4, MOV) with synchronized audio using a dedicated, high-performance FFmpeg backend.
*   **Full Scene Serialization:** Save and load your entire workspace, including the node graph, shader code, and UI parameters, to a JSON file.
*   **Shadertoy Integration:** Fetch and load shaders directly from Shadertoy.com by ID or URL, and they are instantly available as nodes.
*   **Customizable UI Themes:** Switch between several built-in UI themes to customize the look and feel of the editor.

## Dependencies

RaymarchVibe relies on the following libraries, which are fetched automatically using CMake's `FetchContent` where possible:

* C++17 Compiler: (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
* CMake: (version 3.15 or higher)
* OpenGL: (version 3.3 or higher)
* GLFW: For windowing and input.
* Dear ImGui: For the graphical user interface.
* ImGuiColorTextEdit: For the enhanced shader code editor.
* GLAD: OpenGL Loading Library.
* cpp-httplib: For fetching shaders from Shadertoy.com (requires OpenSSL for HTTPS).
* nlohmann/json: For parsing JSON data (used with Shadertoy API).

**System Libraries (Linux):**
While CMake automatically fetches and builds libraries like GLFW, you still need the development headers for their underlying dependencies (like X11 and OpenGL) to be present on your system.

* OpenGL development libraries (e.g `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `freeglut3-dev`)
* GLFW development libraries (e.g `libglfw3-dev`)
* X11 development libraries (e.g `libx11-dev`, `libxrandr-dev`, `libxinerama-dev`, `libxcursor-dev`, `libxi-dev`)
* OpenSSL development libraries (e.g `libssl-dev`) for HTTPS Shadertoy fetching.

## Build Instructions (Linux)

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nicthegreatest/raymarchvibe
    cd raymarchvibe/
    ```

2.  Install Dependencies (if not already present):
    ```bash
    # For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential cmake libgl1-mesa-dev libglfw3-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libssl-dev libx264-dev
    ```

3.  Configure with CMake:
    Create a build directory and run cmake from within it.
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```
    *   If you wish to disable HTTPS for Shadertoy fetching, you can turn off the SSL option from within the `build` directory:
        ```bash
        cmake .. -DRAYMARCHVIBE_ENABLE_SSL=OFF
        ```

4.  Build the project:
    From within the `build` directory, run `make`. This system has 12 processor cores.
    ```bash
    make -j12
    ```

5.  Run RaymarchVibe:
    The executable is located in the `build` directory.
    ```bash
    ./RaymarchVibe
    ```


## In the works

> Switch between mouse input and WASD keys for camera control.
> Ability to handle larger more complex shaders in a way that preserves that 'instantaneous feel'.
> Easier macOS and Windows compatability

## Development Notes

### Working with Shaders

The project is configured to automatically copy all files from the source `shaders/` directory to the application's runtime directory every time you build the project using `make`.

If you edit a `.frag` file, simply re-running `make` from the `build/` directory is sufficient to update it for the application.

```bash
# From within the build/ directory, after editing a shader
make -j12
```

You only need to re-run `cmake ..` before `make` if you add or remove C++ source files or change the project's structure in `CMakeLists.txt`.
